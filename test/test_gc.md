This Python script is a test suite focusing on evaluating the garbage collection (GC) behavior in the `tinygrad` library, particularly ensuring that `Tensor` objects are correctly garbage collected. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

1. **Import Statements**: The script imports necessary modules, including `gc` for garbage collection functionality, `unittest` for the testing framework, `numpy`, and `Tensor` from the `tinygrad` library.

2. **Helper Function `tensors_allocated`**:
   - This function calculates the number of `Tensor` instances currently in memory by iterating over all objects tracked by the garbage collector.

3. **Test Class `TestGC`**:
   - The class contains test methods designed to check the garbage collection of `Tensor` objects under different scenarios.

4. **Test Methods**:
   - **`test_gc`**: This method tests the basic garbage collection functionality. It creates tensors `a` and `b`, performs operations on them, and then deletes them. The test ensures that the number of `Tensor` instances in memory first increases and then drops back to zero after deletion.
   - **`test_gc_complex`**: This method performs a more complex test. It creates tensors `a` and `b`, checks the count of `Tensor` instances, performs operations, and then deletes `b`. It then recreates `b`, performs more operations, and deletes `b` again. This test checks the tensor count at various stages to ensure that tensors are allocated and deallocated correctly.

5. **Execution Entry Point**:
   - The script concludes with `if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()`, allowing it to be run as a standalone program to execute the tests.

This test suite is crucial for ensuring that the `tinygrad` library correctly handles memory management, especially the garbage collection of tensors. Proper GC behavior is essential to prevent memory leaks in applications that create and destroy many tensors during their execution.
