### Documentation for Python Script: Testing Unary, Binary, and Ternary Operations

This Python script, using the `unittest` framework, is designed to test unary, binary, and ternary operations in the context of the `tinygrad` library. It verifies the functionality of these operations across various data types, including floats, integers, and booleans.

#### Script Overview

1. **Imports:**
   - Standard Python modules: `unittest`, `math`
   - NumPy for numerical operations
   - Relevant classes and functions from `tinygrad`

2. **Helper Functions:**
   - `_uops_to_prg(uops)`: Converts a list of unary operations (`UOp`) to a program using the default device.
   - `uop(uops, uop, dtype, vin, arg)`: Helper to append a unary operation to the provided list.
   - `_test_single_value(vals, op, dts)`: Tests a single value operation.
   - `_test_single_value_const(vals, op, dts)`: Tests a single value operation with constant values.

3. **Testing Classes:**
   - `TestUOps`: Base class for testing unary operations. Contains methods for asserting equality and testing operations.
   - `TestFloatUOps`: Subclass of `TestUOps` specifically for testing operations with `float32` data type.
   - `TestNonFloatUOps`: Subclass of `TestUOps` for testing operations with non-float data types like `int32` and `bool`.

4. **Test Execution:**
   - Tests are run using `unittest.main()`, providing detailed test execution results.

#### Key Functions and Test Cases

1. **Unary Operations (`UnaryOps`):**
   - Tests include negation (`NEG`), exponential (`EXP2`), logarithmic (`LOG2`), sine (`SIN`), and square root (`SQRT`) functions.

2. **Binary Operations (`BinaryOps`):**
   - Tests include addition (`ADD`), subtraction (`SUB`), multiplication (`MUL`), division (`DIV`), maximum (`MAX`), less than (`CMPLT`), and modulo (`MOD`) operations.

3. **Ternary Operations (`TernaryOps`):**
   - Tests include multiply and accumulate (`MULACC`) and conditional selection (`WHERE`) operations.

#### Testing Strategy

- Each operation is tested with a set of predefined values.
- The script tests the operations for various data types (`float32`, `int32`, `bool`, etc.).
- Tests are designed to compare the results of the `tinygrad` operations with equivalent Python/NumPy operations to ensure correctness.
- Special cases, such as division by zero and operations on negative numbers, are also tested.

#### Usage

- The script is used to verify the correctness of the operations implemented in the `tinygrad` library.
- It ensures that the library's operations behave as expected across different data types and edge cases.
- It is part of the `tinygrad` library's test suite and helps maintain the library's reliability and accuracy.
